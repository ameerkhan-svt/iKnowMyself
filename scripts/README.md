```javascript
const subjects = [
  'Mathematics', 'Science', 'English', 'History', 'Geography',
  'Art', 'Music', 'Physical Education' // Add your subjects
];
```

### Add Question Templates
Update the `questionTemplates` object:
```javascript
const questionTemplates = {

## Prerequisites

- Backend API running on http://localhost:1337
- Valid JWT token
- Courses and classes already exist in database
- Teacher account with valid ID

## Troubleshooting

1. **"No courses or classes found"**
   - Ensure you have created courses and classes in your database first

2. **"Authorization failed"**
   - Check your JWT token is valid and not expired
   - Ensure the token format is correct (without "Bearer " prefix)

3. **"Connection refused"**
   - Verify your backend is running on port 1337
   - Check the API_BASE_URL in the script

4. **High failure rate**
   - Check server logs for validation errors
   - Ensure course and class IDs exist
   - Verify teacher ID is valid
